 September 20th 2019 (Update) -> Pagination is complete and working, The last button has been 
  removed and replaced with the last page showing up after "..." and before "Next" buttons. Also 
  the ability to change the number of items displayed on the table per page has been added.

  September 23th 2019 (update) -> Added the ability to use a sort search bar to sort through the 
  table, it works and re sets the table on keyup. Also Added the edit button, when clicked 
  an overlay is displayed with a form with all the fields populated. The user can then close the
  form. There is a submit button however the functionality to submit is to long for the time I had
  Left. But other than that the module is almost done.

  October 8th 2019(update) -> I found an error with search bar, the error would mess up the search results.
  This error was easily fixable, now the Search bar should be working perfectly. I believe this module
  is ready for to be added to the website, any other errors that should arise should be minor and easily
  fixed if we keep the JavaScript of each module separated.

  October 11th 2019 (update) -> Fixed a new issue with the search bar, instead i just delete everything
  in the searchResults before re searching the data. The second thing I fixed was the delete button issue,
  the issue was if you deleted something while searching then it would not delete and would mess up the
  table display. Finally after some testing i found out how to recreate the issue with the table
  displaying a weird amount of items on the table.

  October 15th 2019 (update) -> Fixed the issue with the final page messing up the the specific page
  function due to the last page not always having a full set of data. This should be one of the last
  updates needed before the module is added to the template.

  October 16th 2019 (update) -> Found an issue with the delete button, if the user deleted the last item on the
  page the table would just show a blank page and the pagination would get messed up. To fix this I decided
  to add code to the displayTable function that would check if there are no items displaying on the screen.
  if the number of nulls that show up in the for loop are equal to the number of items that are able to be
  displayed on the screen then the table is empty. So all i did was add a check for this and then remove 
  the table and pagination if this is true and reduce the page number by 1 and the pageStart and pageEnd
  by the number of items able to be displayed on the screen. This seem to fix the issue but a little 
  more testing should be done, other than testing this fix I cant think of any other issues that could 
  arise with this module.

  October 18th 2019 (update) -> Earlier this week I attempted to build a program based on an idea I had about a 
  website for RPG encounters(role playing), which would allow the user to keep track of engagements made during
  Warhammer 40k RPG sessions. While I was setting this up I had a plan to build a table that would display
  all the possible enemies and their stats. While I was trying to do this I realized that the code for the 
  table I have been building for this task manager could easily be used for my Warhammer idea. At its current
  state the program is hard coded to only fit this task program, however after much thought I realized that with
  some modifications to the code I could reuse this table/pagination project for other programs down the line
  instead of constantly having to re program a slightly different version of the same program each time.

  Today I began the process of restructuring the code I currently have, first I moved all the code to its own
  JS file. I also added the code and put it inside of a JavaScript class, setting up all the variables inside
  of the constructor and kept all the functions. I had to do some minor changes to make the code work like 
  adding "this" to the variables I declared in the constructor and binding "this" to event handlers. Finally
  to get the table to work and display, I create a new Table object and call the function createTable(). There
  are still a few things to add to help make this table/pagination program reusable.

  October 21st 2019 (update) -> I continued the the restructuring of this code and I am almost finished everything
  required for this program to be complete. Today I made a lot more changes, first things I removed the delete
  and edit eventListeners and their functions and moved them each to a separate folder. The reason for this
  that the functionality of these two things are not core to pagination and table display, they are things that
  can be added on top of it to make it better and I have designed the code so that other programmers can use 
  their code with this. I also added the functionality to have the table, pagination, search bar and dropdown
  to be added bia JavaScript. This allows me to put in checks to see if the user wants the search bar and 
  dropdown to even display. I also removed the overlay and its form since that is not something I am keeping
  with the core code of this program, this code is meant to be simple and reusable, I just want the functions
  that will be used across the projects and anything else can be tailored to the program of choice.

  I only have a few things left to add to this program, I should have this done by the end of the current
  week, if not by the end of the month for sure. Once everything is added, I will comment my code properly and
  clean it up, then I will be able to start using it for my other programs.


  October 21st 2019 (update & release) -> Today I finished up the last things to do for this project/module.
  I added the ability for the programmer to have their own numbers to be added to the display dropdown.
  I also added in some validation for the inputs going into the constructor and before the table is
  created. I finally organized the two other folders that contain the delete and edit functions i created.
  Finally I will be puting the example code from this module in a folder, and the main folder housing
  this module will have the JS file and a folder that says example.
